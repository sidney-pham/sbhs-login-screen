  <h1>Sydney Boys High School Login Page</h1>
  <p>The requirements didn't really specify what was determined in the 'requirements analysis' stage. I inferred that the desired modifications included:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>An image based background. (This seemed the most obvious difference between the <a href="http://student.sbhs.net.au/images/stories/intranet/student/NewLoginScreen.png">proposed design</a> and the <a href="https://login.sbhs.net.au">current login screen</a>.)</li>
    <li>A more modern/less boring(?) design. The current design is white on black and uses standard UI elements (e.g., input[type=submit] without styling).</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="sbhs-login.html">Suggested screen.</a>
      <ul>
        <li>This is the suggested design.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="sbhs-login-error.html">Suggested screen showing errors.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="sbhs-login.html">Who knows</a>
    </li>

- ?action=register
- title
- choose Header text 'Intranet Portal'
- font choice suggest Lato
- On login error, add p.login-error-message by inserting dom node or toggling a class that sets display.
  - Also add class "login-error-form" to form#login-form
- Probably should use HTML5 validation / constraint api.
